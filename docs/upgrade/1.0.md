## Breaking changes

The deprecated `lambda()` function has been removed. If you were defining Lambda handlers with it, remove the call to the function. For example:

```php
// Before
return lambda(function (array $event) {
    return 'Hello ' . $event['name'];
});

// After
return function (array $event) {
    return 'Hello ' . $event['name'];
};
```

The deprecated `$_SERVER['LAMBDA_CONTEXT']` has been removed in favor of `$_SERVER['LAMBDA_REQUEST_CONTEXT']` (same content).

The `vendor/bin/bref bref.dev` command has been removed.
