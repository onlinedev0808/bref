introduction: Learn how to deal with assets and static files to deploy serverless PHP websites.
---

Websites usually contain 2 parts:

- PHP code, running on [AWS Lambda + API Gateway with the HTTP runtime](/docs/runtimes/http.md)
- static files (CSS, JSâ€¦), [hosted on AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html)

> Before reading this article we assume that you have read [Bref's introduction](/docs/first-steps.md) and that you are familiar with [Bref's HTTP runtime](/docs/runtimes/http.md).

It is possible to use these services with custom domains to build websites, however there are limitations:

- API Gateway is *HTTPS only* (there is no HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection)
- S3 will host assets on a different domain than API Gateway

If these are acceptable for your use case, that is great. Continue to the next section to learn more.

However, if you need API Gateway to support HTTP (to redirect to HTTPS), or if you need assets to be served via the same domain as the API, then you will need to use [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) (the AWS CDN). This is detailed below in this page.

## Hosting static files with S3

### Creating a S3 bucket

S3 stores files in "buckets". You will need to create one for your website.

If you plan on serving the static files directly from S3 using a custom domain, the bucket name must be named after the domain. For example `assets.example.com`. Learn more about this [in the official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html).

If you plan to use CloudFront you can use any name for the bucket.

In order to automate everything let's create and configure the bucket using `serverless.yml`:

```yaml
...

resources:
    Resources:
        # The S3 bucket that stores the assets
        Assets:
            Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
            Properties:
                BucketName: <bucket-name>
                # Enables static website hosting
                WebsiteConfiguration:
                    IndexDocument: index.html # Use index.html as the root file
                # Enables CORS (e.g. when a JS script loads files from S3)
                CorsConfiguration:
                    CorsRules:
                        -   AllowedHeaders: ["*"]
                            AllowedMethods: [GET]
                            AllowedOrigins: ["*"]
        # The policy that makes the bucket publicly readable (necessary for a public website)
        AssetsBucketPolicy:
            Type: AWS::S3::BucketPolicy
            Properties:
                Bucket: !Ref Assets
                PolicyDocument:
                    Statement:
                        -   Effect: 'Allow'
                            Principal: '*' # everyone
                            Action: 's3:GetObject' # to read
                            Resource: '#{Assets.Arn}/*' # things in the bucket
```

After [deploying](/docs/deploy.md), the static files will be served from `http://<bucket-name>.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com` or `http://<bucket-name>.s3-website.<region>.amazonaws.com` (see [this AWS article for the correct URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_website_region_endpoints)). Read the next section to upload your files.

You can either [setup a custom domain to point to this URL](environment/custom-domains.md#custom-domains-for-static-websites-on-s3) or setup CloudFront as explained below.

### Uploading files to S3

It is not possible to use `sam deploy` to upload files to S3, you need to upload them separately. To do this, you can use the `aws s3 sync` command:

```bash
aws s3 sync <directory> s3://<bucket-name> --delete
```

Be aware that the content of the bucket is public!

## Serving PHP and static files via CloudFront

This section assumes you have already deployed your static files on S3 as shown above.

As explained at the beginning of this page, CloudFront will let us:

- serve the PHP application and static files under the same domain
- support both HTTP and HTTPS

This diagram helps understand how CloudFront works:

![](cloudfront.png)

CloudFront dispatches HTTP requests to "Origins" (API Gateway/Lambda, S3, etc.) based on "Cache Behaviors". A cache behavior can match a specific URL pattern, and can have a specific caching configuration (e.g. cache assets for a long time but do not cache PHP responses).

The `template.yaml` example below:

- receives HTTP and HTTPS requests
- serves everything URL that starts with `/assets/` using S3 (static files)
- sends all the other requests to PHP via API Gateway

Feel free to customize the `/asset/` path. If your application is a JavaScript application backed by a PHP API, you will want to invert API Gateway and S3 (set S3 as the `DefaultCacheBehavior` and serve API Gateway under a `/api/` path).

> The first deployment takes a lot of time (20 minutes) because CloudFront is a distributed service. The next deployments that do not modify CloudFront's configuration will not suffer from this delay.

The URL of the deployed CloudFront distribution can be found in [the CloudFront dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home?region=eu-west-1#) under `Domain Name`.

### Setting up a domain name

Just like in the "[Custom domains](/docs/environment/custom-domains.md)" guide, you need to register your domain in **ACM** (AWS Certificate Manager) to get a HTTPS certificate.

- open [this link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1#/wizard/) or manually go in the ACM Console and click "Request a new certificate" **in the `us-east-1` region** (CloudFront requires certificates from `us-east-1`)
- add your domain name and click "Next"
- choose the domain validation of your choice
    - domain validation will require you to add entries to your DNS configuration
    - email validation will require you to click a link you will receive in an email sent to `admin@your-domain.com`

After validating the domain and the certificate we can now configure it in `template.yaml`.

Copy the ARN of the ACM certificate. It should look like this:

```
arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:216536346254:certificate/322f12ee-1165-4bfa-a41f-08c932a2935d
```

Add your domain name under `Aliases` and configure `ViewerCertificate` to use your custom HTTPS certificate:

```yaml
Resources:
    ...
    WebsiteCDN:
        Type: AWS::CloudFront::Distribution
        Properties:
            DistributionConfig:
                ...
                # Custom domain name
                Aliases:
                    - <custom-domain> # e.g. example.com
                ViewerCertificate:
                    # ARN of the certificate created in ACM
                    AcmCertificateArn: <certificate-arn>
                    # See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fr_fr/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_ViewerCertificate.html
                    SslSupportMethod: 'sni-only'
```

The last step will be to point your domain name to the CloudFront URL:

- open [the CloudFront dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home?region=eu-west-1#) and look for the URL under `Domain Name`
- create a CNAME to point your domain name to this URL
    - if you use Route53 you can read [the official guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html)
    - if you use another registrar and you want to point your root domain (without `www.`) to CloudFront, you will need to use a registrar that supports this (for example [CloudFlare allows this with a technique called CNAME flattening](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169056-Understand-and-configure-CNAME-Flattening))
